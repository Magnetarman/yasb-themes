## Windows 9x but MODERN
I really enjoy the "computery" feel of the old windows user interface (pre-frutiger aero). I brought this aesthetic to YASB while keeping the modern usefulness of the tool.

## Configuring the colors
As you might noticed there is a primary "vivid" gradient that goes from pink to cyan. If you don't like this or want different colors you must go into the theme's CSS file and change the --vivid-gradient value to anything you want

There you can also adjust the color of the interface and the darker color used for nested elements. The color is based off the WindowsXP classic theme, which is slightly yellower than the windows 98 gray, which is #d6d6d6

Adding new widgets should automatically work, however menus and pop-ups won't have backgrounds.
